Backend acts as an API to the sql server (i.e. allows one to access data in database)
Here, express is being used which is a framework of Node.js. Node.js is commonly used for server side actions
in javascript applications

Things to keep in mind:
- need to put in this command "> npm i -D nodemon" to automatically restart the node server 
everytime a change is made, otherwise the results won't be reflected. TO not have to do this everytime, add
"scripts": {
    "dev": "npx nodemon app.js"
  }, 
to package.json
Then run "npm run dev" 

- download dependency
  delete node_modules
  delete package-lock.json
  npm install
